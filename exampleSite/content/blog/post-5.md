**Q1. What is the proposed National Bad Bank?**

The Union Budget has proposed an asset reconstruction company (ARC) that will take over stressed debt from banks.

**Q2. How will this work?**

A new ARC will be formed which will buy Non Performing Assets (NPAs) from banks. This ARC will act like a holding company to an asset management company (AMC) which will try to recover money by selling NPAs to funds that buy distressed assets.

**Q3. How does it help banks?**

The transfer of NPAs from their books to a professionally managed ARC will help the banks in getting a better value for the clean part of their loan book. This will increase their ability to raise growth capital. A second benefit would be that the management of banks will now be freed up to give more focus on growth. The biggest beneficiaries of this would be the Public Sector Banks.

**Q4. Who will provide capital for this?**

Banks will provide capital for it while the government would provide guarantee.

**Q5. How much money will be required for this?**

It is estimated that the new ARC will require at least INR 15000 crore.

**Q6. How much bad loans will it be acquiring?**

The total NPA as of September 2020 were INR 7 lakh crore which is 7.5% of total bank loans. Out of this around INR 3 lakh crore is expected to be acquired by the bad bank.

**Q7. Does it solve the NPA problem?**

There is skepticism that this would be more of an accounting escape for banks and might not build up trust with investors.
