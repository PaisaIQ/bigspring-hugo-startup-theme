· Aswath Damodaran is a professor of finance at New York University’s Stern School of Business. He is more popularly known as ‘Dean of valuation’ on Wall Street for his simple yet comprehensive valuation framework.

· Damodaran’s valuation framework attempts at combining the story behind business potential to numbers to arrive at the intrinsic value of any business. An individual while taking an investment decision can use his framework to value a business.

· The five step process underlined by him in ‘Narrative and Numbers – The value of stories in business’ has been detailed below:

**(a) Develop a narrative for the business you are valuing:** This is the basic story as to how one sees the business evolving over time.

**(b) Test narrative to see if it’s possible, plausible and probable:** This is the 3P test. The bare minimum is to see if the story is even possible, then to see if it is plausible and then to think in terms of the probability of the story playing out.

**(c) Convert narrative into drivers of value:** Narratives in this step are translated into valuation inputs. Start with potential market size, move onto cash flows and risk. Each part of your narrative should be represented by the relevant valuation input.

**(d) Connect the drivers of value to a valuation:** Create an intrinsic valuation model that connects the input to an end value in business.

**Keep the feedback loop open:** Listen to people who know the business better than you do and use suggestions to fine-tune the narrative.
